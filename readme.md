# Nerdle Solver

The aim of this project is a fairly silly interactive html/javascript solver for https://nerdlegame.com/classic/

To try the automatic solver, you can run it from from your web browser here: https://tonybuk.github.io/NerdleSolver/

The idea is that the Nerdle Solver will generate a guess, you enter it into Nerdle itself, manually assign the colours back into the Nerdle Solver, and it will iterate guesses from there.

It goes without saying, this is 100% unaffiliated with Nerdle.  Currently it will only solve Nerdle Classic and Speed out of the box.  There's hypothetical support for Mini and Instant, but these have to be enabled by hand editing the nerdleglobals.js currently.  I'll either let you choose the game on startup, or maybe just cheat and have extra HTML files to set this up.

This just leaves Nerdle Pro, which is only supported if the operators match Nerdle Classic, and the expression matches Classic or Mini.  Support for the extra operators may be added in the future, albeit because Nerdle Pro supports arbitrary length expressions, I'll need to allow the first suggestion to be auto-generated as well, whereas I can cheat on Classic/Mini.  However the quality of the first guess is critical, since the more unique values that are discovered, the more information we are guarenteed to get on the first guess.

**Usage**

Using the Webpage is simply a matter of performing these repeating steps...

1. Enter your guess into the Solver.  This can either be your own guess, or the suggestion.
* If you want to use the Suggestion, just click on Use Suggestion.
* Otherwise, type in your guess and Press Enter.
3. Enter that same guess into Nerdle.
4. Click on each of the Numbers/Operators in the solver until the colours match Nerdle.  Press Enter when done.
* Super duper double check it matches.
6. Go back to 1

The Gold Suggestion at the bottom is there to let you know what the current suggestion is, if 

**About**

So... how does this work?

Firstly, this needs to implement Nerdle itself, so I've essentially reverse engineered the parser by just throwing various inputs at it.  So here's some rules.

* Unary operators are allowed, and they stack, albeit I highly doubt they'll ever be used in any of the classic puzzles...
  * This means the following are 100% legal.

        --1+-1=0 (this reduces to: 1 - 1 = 0)
        +-+-1=+1 (this reduces to: 1     = 1)

* Leading zeroes are allowed, and there's no limit to them, albeit again, I highly doubt they'll ever be used in any of the classic puzzles...
  * This means the following are 100% legal.
  
        01*001=1 (this reduces to: 1 * 1 = 1)

* Otherwise standard Wordle rules apply.
  * Green on the guess means a number/operator is in the right position.
  * Green on the keyboard means at least one instance of the number/operator has been correctly deduced in the right position.
  * Purple on the guess means a number/operator is needed, but the position is wrong.
  * Purple on the keyboard means at least one instance of the number/operator is needed, but the exact position is unknown.
  * Black on the guess means this instance of the number/operator isn't needed.
    * If it's the *only* time this number/operator has been guessed in this round, then it isn't used anywhere.
    * If it's not the *only* time this number/operator has been guessed in this round, then it is needed, but this instance indicates we have too many.
  * Black on the keyboard means the number/operator is not used anywhere in the solution.

So as indicated, black on guesses is where things get interesting, as what it tells us is how *many* instances of a number/operator are needed.

Secondly, the part you're here for, the solver...

**Initial Game State**

Initially we know a few things, there's 8 entries, but we can rule reduce some already.

    Col : What we know...
    === : ===================================
      1 : Can only be one of 0123456789+-
      2 : Can only be one of 0123456789+-*/=
      3 : Can only be one of 0123456789+-*/=
      4 : Can only be one of 0123456789+-*/=
      5 : Can only be one of 0123456789+-*/=
      6 : Can only be one of 0123456789+-*/=
      7 : Can only be one of 0123456789+-*/=
      8 : Can only be one of 0123456789

We also know some things about the legal inputs:

    Input : What we know...
    ===== : ===================================
        0 : Can occur between 0 and 7 times
        1 : Can occur between 0 and 7 times
        2 : Can occur between 0 and 7 times
        3 : Can occur between 0 and 7 times
        4 : Can occur between 0 and 7 times
        5 : Can occur between 0 and 7 times
        6 : Can occur between 0 and 7 times
        7 : Can occur between 0 and 7 times
        8 : Can occur between 0 and 7 times
        9 : Can occur between 0 and 7 times
        + : Can occur between 0 and 5 times
        - : Can occur between 0 and 5 times
        * : Can occur between 0 and 3 times
        / : Can occur between 0 and 3 times
        = : Must occur only once

The interesting part that helps define this is the very last row.  Whilst we can position = in up to 6 positions, we know we can only have one of them.  We can also condense the operators further.  We know * and / must be nested between numbers, meaning for multiply/divide, the most you'll see is based on:

    0*0*0=00

Whereas because +/- can also be unary operators, it's 5 times, with the following being the longest legal expression:

    -----0=0

So any solutions proposed will be limited by the above knowledge.  We know what items can go in what positions, and we know a min/max for each.  The purpose of the solver therefore is once a solution is entered, use the colours returned to *refine* what we know about they game state, which will further reduce the potential solutions.

So each time a black entry is returned, we can refine two things:

* We can refine the maximum number of times an input can occur.
* We can refine the legal positions for the inputs since we know a position it *can't* go.
* And obviously if the maximum number of times is zero (i.e. input only tried once, and black was returned), we can remove it entirely from consideration.

Each time a purple entry is returned, we can refine two things:

* We can refine the minimum number if tunes an input can occur.
* We can refine the legal positions for the inputs since we know a position it *can't* go.

Each time a green entry is returned, we can again refine two things:

* We can refine the minimum number if tunes an input can occur.
* We can refine the legal inputs for a given position since we know what it *must* be.

And after processing these...

* If the total of all the minimums for all possible entries exactly matches the number of spaces digits can go, then we know exactly how many of each type of number we can actually use.  Meaning we now just have to set all the max's to the min values.

The idea is we want to end up with a scenario where:

* All the min/max's are the same, meaning we know exactly how many times each input is used.
* All the positions have exactly one entry, meaning we know exactly what input is used in what position.

The closer we get to achieving this, the less possible permutations there are that satisfy a balanced equation.

In terms of the balanced equation, we need to find an equation that meets the known criteria:

* All known positions are filled with the input.
* All unknown positions are filled with the possible inputs.
* The total of each of the inputs that are used/not used all satisfy the known ranges for each input.
* If possible, avoid solutions which abuse stacking unary +/- and leading zeroes, these will only be used if all other possibilities have been eliminated.
* If possible, avoid solutions which abuse multiplying by zero, these will only be used if all other possibility have been eliminated.

Currently solutions are offered in three passes.

* Pass 1: Satisfying answers.
  * This assumes that the answer won't include NOP arithmetic, such as 10*0-0=0, and that answers won't abuse unary operators or leading zeroes.
* Pass 2: OK answers
  * This allows NOP arithmatic, but doesn't allow answers to abuse unary operators/leading zeroes.
* Pass 3: Naff Answers
  * If the parser accepts it, this will propose it.

*** Compatability ***

This goes back at least as far as Internet Explorer 11 (what I'm forced to use at work).  Going back further would force me to give up const, which doesn't feel great, but if there's demand, I'm sure I can start regressing the code to support older standards........... maybe.  Though a quick look implies:

* Internet Explorer 10 - Change all const's to var's (yuck).
* Internet Explorer 9 - DOMTokenList no longer exists, meaning I'd probably need to re-write all the code for setting/removing class's for the CSS style.

It's all doable, but again, given I've ostensibly designed this for a mobile, I'm a bit loathed to start making changes which overly comprimise the code.  IE 11 was at least just a few simple wrappers / default parameter handling.
