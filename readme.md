# Nerdle Solver

The aim of this project is a fairly silly interactive solver for https://nerdlegame.com/classic/

This is all performed in a self contained interactive webpage.  The idea is that the Nerdle Solver will generate a guess, you enter it into Nerdle itself, manually assign the colours back into the Nerdle Solver, and it will iterate guesses from there.
