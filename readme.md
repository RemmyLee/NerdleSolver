# Nerdle Solver

The aim of this project is a fairly silly interactive solver for https://nerdlegame.com/classic/

This is all performed in a self contained interactive webpage.  The idea is that the Nerdle Solver will generate a guess, you enter it into Nerdle itself, manually assign the colours back into the Nerdle Solver, and it will iterate guesses from there.

It goes without saying, this is 100% unaffiliated with Nerdle.  Currently it will only solve Nerdle Classic out of the box.  It does interally support solving Nerdle Pro, however this will require some hand cranking to enable the appropriate operators.
